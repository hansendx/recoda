ReCodA (Research Code Analysis)
===============================

This project aims to evaluate research software projects for scientific analysis.
It measures the software projects based on criteria, focused on researchers needs.

Faulty code or code that is not understood correctly can lead to problems in the reproducibility
of results, the validity of results obtained using it and can promote software abandonment
and constant rewriting of software.
